# Getting access to GenomeDKâ€™s cluster

To follow this class, you must have an account on the [GenomeDK](https://genome.au.dk). To get that, go to their [getting started page](https://genome.au.dk/docs/getting-started/#request-access) and fill out the request form on the first page (under *Get access to the cluster*). Do this as early as possible, as there can be some delay between requesting and getting access, and you will need access to do some of the exercises in the class.
